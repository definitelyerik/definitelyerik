## 👋🏻 Welcome!

My name is Erik and I am a 32-year-old entrepreneur from Spain. I enjoy expanding and growing my knowledge in multiple disciplines: writing, coding, photography, design…

I currently am working on a few different projects, but still dabble on writing/translating, doing some minimalist front-end web design and honing my back-end skills in my free time. I also teach some courses within my regular work hours!

I’m a huge advocate of open-source code and try to build my projects based on that philosophy; I thrive on building clean, minimalist, open and free products.

This is a LGBTQ+ friendly space, as well as a safe space in general. My pronouns are he/him and would define myself as kind and approachable so feel free to contact me at any given time!

# Things I’m currently working on
- Learning about PWAs and developing a mobile app through [Flutter]( https://flutter.dev/).
- Designing and developing a secret little game using [RPG Maker MV]( https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/rpg-maker-mv).
- Building a product webpage for some side projects using [Hugo]( https://gohugo.io/).
  
# Some fun facts about me and my skills
- 👨🏻‍💻 My first ever programming course was taught in [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)) (I wish I was kidding).
- 🎨 My first ever graphical interface was built with [Java Swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)) and almost made me quit on learning about web-design.
- 🌍 I speak Spanish, German, English and Italian fluently. I have also dabbled in French, Croatian, Japanese and Polish but have not practiced most of them for quite some time so I probably am no longer functional in those.
- 🤝 If you want or need collaboration for a project just contact me! I’m told I am very friendly and always looking for a good conversation!
